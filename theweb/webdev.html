    <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>

    <p>
      Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
      Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
      development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
      text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
      network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
      development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web
      content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
      Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

    <p>
      Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
      non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2]
      Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
      changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
